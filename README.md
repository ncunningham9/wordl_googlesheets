# wordl_googlesheets
This is a Google Sheets version of the popular Wordl game. It should copy over to Excel fairly easily.

How it Works: 

1. On the "Key" tab, write in ten words that you want to guess
2. On each "team" tab, remove the currently-populated answers in column B
3. Each team guesses for each round
4. Hide the "Key" tab so that the players don't see it
5. After everyone plays, go to the results page to tally the results.



Variations: 
1. If you don't want to play 10 rounds, you can hide (or delete) the other rounds on the team pages and results page. 
2. If you want to score differently, just change the point value on the "Key" tab
3. You can play with individuals instead of teams
